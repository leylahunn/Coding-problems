# Java Problems

The purpose of this repository is to document projects and challenges completed in Java as I practice, as well as keeping track of my progress while learning and solving challenges from websites such as codewars.com, w3resource.com and codingbat.com. These challenges will increase in difficulty level as I progress. I have used the IntelliJ IDE to practice these challenges.

| Challenge | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Hello World](https://github.com/leylahunn/Java-problems/blob/master/hello-world) | A simple 'Hello World' application. |
| [Calculator](https://github.com/leylahunn/Java-problems/blob/master/coding-problems/calculator) | A simple calculator which finds the sum, division, multiplication and subtraction of numbers. |
| [Squares](https://github.com/leylahunn/Java-problems/blob/master/coding-problems/square) | Finding the square of two numbers, finding the sum of these squares, finding the root of square numbers |
| [Scanner](https://github.com/leylahunn/Java-problems/blob/master/coding-problems/scanner) | Creating a simple 'scanner' app to practice its functionality and implementation |
| [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/leylahunn/Java-problems/tree/master/coding-problems/rock-paper-scissors) | A personalised game of 'Rock, paper, scissors' using a scanner and objects |

Future project ideas: 
- Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.

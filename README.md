# Java Problems

The purpose of this repository is to document projects and challenges completed in Java as I practice, as well as keeping track of my progress while learning and solving challenges from websites such as codewars.com, w3resource.com and codingbat.com. These challenges will increase in difficulty level as I progress. I have used the IntelliJ IDE to practice these challenges.

| Challenge | Description | Completed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project 1: [Hello World] | A simple 'Hello World' application. | - [x]
| Project 2: [Calculator] | A simple calculator which finds the sum, division, multiplication and subtraction of numbers. | -[x]
| Project 3: [Squares] | Finding the square of two numbers, finding the sum of these squares, finding the root of square numbers | -[x]
| Project 4: [Scanner] | Creating a simple 'scanner' app to practice its functionality and implementation | -[x]
| Project 5: [RPS] | A personalised game of 'Rock, paper, scissors' using a scanner and objects | -[x]

Future project ideas: 
- Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.

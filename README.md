Java Problems
The purpose of this repository is to document my practice with using Java, as well as to keep track of my progress while learning and solving challenges from websites like codewars.com, w3resource.com and codingbat.com. These challenges will increase in difficulty level as I progress. I have used the IntelliJ IDE to practice these challenges.

Program 1: A simple 'Hello World' application created with Java in the Visual Studio Code IDE.
Program 2: A simple calculator; finding the sum of numbers, division, multiplication and subtraction.
Program 3: Square numbers - Finding the square of two numbers, finding the sum of these squares, finding the root of square numbers.
Program 4: Simple 'Scanner' app
Program 5: 'Rock, Paper, Scissors!' game
